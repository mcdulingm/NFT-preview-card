## My process

I set my set styles and then build the structure of the card. I then connect the styling and structure from a mobile first approach.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS/SCSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I had to recall how to use after/before and hover/focus in SCSS. Very basic but if I don't do this everyday I have to go back and look it up.

### Continued development

I'm going to continue focusing on improving my SASS/SCSS.
